# Array-DataStructure
This repository is all about the Array data structure. We add all possible questions and approaches for better understanding towards Array.

The array is the most commonly used data storage structure; it’s built into most programming languages.there are two kinds of data in Java: primitive types (such as int and double) and objects. In many programming languages, arrays are primitive types, but in Java they’re treated as objects. Accordingly, you must use the new operator to create an array.

We have to declare the size of array at the time when we instatiate the array, so it is fixed in size and we can't change the size of array. Array data structure have three basic operation that are

1-insertion

2-deletion

3-searching.
